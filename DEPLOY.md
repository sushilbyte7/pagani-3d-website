# Deploying to Netlify

Since this is a Next.js application, deploying to Netlify is straightforward.

## Option 1: Git (Recommended)
1. Push this project to your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository.
2. Log in to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com).
3. Click **"Add new site"** -> **"Import from existing project"**.
4. Select your repository.
5. Netlify will automatically detect Next.js.
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory**: `out` (Generated by static export)
6. Click **Deploy**.

## Option 2: Drag & Drop (Static Export)
If you prefer not to use Git:
1. Run `npm run build` locally.
2. A folder named `out` will be created in your project.
3. Drag and drop the `out` folder directly into Netlify's "Sites" page.

**Recommendation:** Option 2 is now perfectly set up for you!
